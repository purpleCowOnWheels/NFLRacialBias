A look at whether NFL teams give up on underperforming black QBs faster than comparable underperforming white QBs

There are many forms of bias. This is a very narrow and imperfect "analysis" and is really just a party trick that shows that in a very biased & arbitrary sample of qbs there are a bunch of white QBs that play terribly but are allowed to keep playing, and some equal or better performing black QBs who get benched.

I've also posted a few peer-reviewed papers that do much more rigorous versions of this analysis
